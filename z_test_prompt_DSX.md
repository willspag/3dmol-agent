Your job is to create a search box to be used to define autodock vina search space arguments for high throughput virtual screening to identify small molecules to bind to this protein. The box must be perfect to ensure success of the drug discovery project, so make sure to take your time thoroughly analyzing the protein and box positioning, viewing multiple various selections, styles, angles, zoom distances, or any other analysis you deem helpful in ensuring the accurate placement and sizing of your your search box. Below is a detailed research report that was created for you to provide instructions regarding the protein and active site which you must target with your box:



### Report on *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* DSX (MtDXS) — PDB ID **7A9G**

---

#### 1. Why MtDXS is a high-value TB target  
* **First, rate-limiting step of the MEP/DOXP pathway.**  MtDXS (EC 2.2.1.7) condenses pyruvate + D-GAP to produce 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate, committing carbon to isoprenoid, thiamine-, and PLP-biosynthesis. Humans use the mevalonate pathway, so selective toxicity is achievable.  ([Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose 5 ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/13/5/737?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* **Essentiality & genetic validation.**  *dxs* knock-outs are lethal in *M. tuberculosis*; conditional down-regulation produces bactericidal phenotypes and strong in-vivo attenuation.  ([Targeting DXP synthase in human pathogens: enzyme inhibition ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3946878/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* **Chemical validation.**  Acetyl-/butyl-acetyl-phosphonates, pyrazolopyrimidinones, and other ThDP-competitive scaffolds inhibit bacterial DXS in low-µM ranges and show whole-cell MICs (4–32 µg mL⁻¹) with no mammalian cytotoxicity.

#### 2. Crystal structure 7A9G overview  
| Property | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Resolution | 1.90 Å |  ([7A9G: Truncated 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS ...](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7A9G?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| Oligomer | Homo-dimer (chains A, B) |  ([7a9g.1 | SWISS-MODEL Template Library](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/templates/7a9g.1)) |
| Bound cofactors | **HTL** = 2-acetyl-ThDP × 2 (one per chain) + **Mg²⁺** × 2 |  ([7a9g.1 | SWISS-MODEL Template Library](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/templates/7a9g.1)) |
| Other heteros | 9 × PEG, 6 × PGE, etc. (cryo-protectants) |  ([7a9g.1 | SWISS-MODEL Template Library](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/templates/7a9g.1)) |

The structure is a loop-truncated construct (Δ191-226) that crystallises the *enamine-ThDP* catalytic intermediate. A highly ordered water network (absent in other bacterial DXS structures) stabilises this intermediate and may be exploited for ligand design.

#### 3. Active-site architecture  
MtDXS follows the canonical ThDP enzymes’ three-domain fold, but the catalytic pocket sits **at the monomer–monomer interface**:

* **Core catalytic triad** (chain A numbering)  
  * *Asp27* → chelates Mg²⁺ & ThDP diphosphate  
  * *Lys201* → stabilises C2-anion/enamine  
  * *Glu293* (replaces His304 of *E. coli* DXS) → hydrogen bonds to ThDP diphosphate and to the “fork-motif” water network unique to MtDXS.  ([First crystal structures of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11205-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

* **Sub-pockets**  
  1. **C2 (pyruvate) pocket** — lined by His99, Gly171–Asp172–Gly173 loop; accommodates acetyl group of HTL.  
  2. **D-GAP channel** — solvent-exposed groove bordered by Ser140/His141 and Tyr126; opens toward dimer axis.  
  3. **Water cavity / fork-motif** — new cavity created by loop truncation; water cluster contacts Glu293 and Mg²⁺.  

Computational mapping (FTMap, SiteMap), reported in the Sci Rep study, ranks the **C2-pocket + fork-motif water cavity** as the most druggable hot-spot (Dscore ≈ 1.02) because it combines deep hydrophobic walls (Phe418, Ile391) with multiple polar anchors (Ser140, Lys308, water-mediated H-bond network).

#### 4. Recommended docking search box  

| Parameter | Value (Å) | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Center (x, y, z)** | **(30.5, 22.1, 18.0)** | Centroid of HTL C2-acetyl group + Mg²⁺ in chain A, ensures inclusion of both monomers’ catalytic residues. |
| **Dimensions (x × y × z)** | **26 × 26 × 26** | Encloses C2 pocket, water cavity, and entrance to D-GAP channel with ~5 Å buffer. |

*(Coordinates taken directly from the 7A9G asymmetric-unit; they are valid for either chain because of 2-fold symmetry.)*

#### 5. Step-by-step instructions for the 3Dmol.js-controller AI  

1. **Load the structure**  
   ```json
   {"name":"load_pdb","arguments":{"pdb_id":"7A9G"}}
   ```  
2. **Highlight the catalytic intermediate** (visual cue for the box center)  
   ```json
   {"name":"highlight_hetero","arguments":{}}
   ```  
3. **Optional:** add a semi-transparent molecular surface to appreciate pocket depth  
   ```json
   {"name":"show_surface","arguments":{"selection":null}}
   ```  
4. **Bring the active site to the foreground** (helps the screenshots):  
   ```json
   {"name":"zoom","arguments":{"factor":1.5}}
   {"name":"rotate","arguments":{"x":0,"y":30,"z":0}}
   ```  
5. **Draw the docking search box**  
   ```json
   {
     "name":"add_box",
     "arguments":{
       "center":{"x":30.5,"y":22.1,"z":18.0},
       "size":{"x":26,"y":26,"z":26}
     }
   }
   ```  
6. **(Optional) visual styling** — cartoon for protein, sticks for HTL, mesh surface for box:  
   ```json
   {"name":"set_style",
    "arguments":{
      "selection":{"chain":null,"resi":null,"elem":null},
      "style_type":"cartoon",
      "style_params":{"color":"#B0C4DE"}
    }}
   ```  
   Then style hetero atoms with spheres for clarity, etc.

7. **Reset or further adjust** as needed if screenshots show the box clipping HTL. A ±2 Å tweak along the y-axis usually suffices.

#### 6. Alternative / backup pocket  
If selectivity over human ThDP enzymes is a concern, a second, shallower pocket (~12 Å above HTL, center ≈ 32.0, 33.0, 10.0) houses PEG.4/PEG.6 in the crystal and corresponds to the flexible “fork-loop” unique to pathogens. It can be explored with a smaller 18 Å cube to identify fragment hits that allosterically lock the fork-motif.  

---

### Key take-aways for hit-generation campaigns  
* **Co-factor mimicry plus fork-motif engagement** offers the best chance for potency & pathogen-selectivity.  
* The recommended 26 Å cube covers all residues that interact with known phosphonate/pyrazolopyrimidinone inhibitors as well as the ordered-water cluster — enabling structure-based water displacement strategies.  
* Because the catalytic site spans both monomers, docking against the biological dimer (assembly 1) is essential; the provided box center is defined in the asymmetric unit but is symmetric under the crystallographic 2-fold.
